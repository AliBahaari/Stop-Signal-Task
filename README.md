# Stop Signal Task
## (Standard + Proactive)
Developed from the work of Logan and Cowan (1984), the stop signal task is a test of inhibition of prepotent responses. It requires the participant to respond as quickly as possible to a predetermined stimulus, the go trial, but to abort any response when a subsequently presented stop signal is displayed.
